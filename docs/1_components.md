# Components

Spot is comprised of a 3D-printed body, some hardware, and a list of electronic components.

## Hardware

Spot is 3D-printed and is a combination of different Spot Micro designs, with some minor modifications.
The original design was developed by KDY0523.

- [KDY0532 original design](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3445283)

The 3D prints are assembled with some additional non-printable components:

- 84x M2x8 screws + M2 nuts
- 92x M3x8 screws + M3 nuts
- 64x M3x20 screws + M3 nuts
- 12x 625ZZ ball bearings

## Electronics

These are the electronics I used for mine, and they can easily be swapped to suit your Spot's needs.

I recommend getting an ESP32-S3 with a camera, allowing for more computation and imaging capabilities.

It means a more responsive robot as it's faster at doing sensor fusion, calculating kinematics and gait planning, and networking.
